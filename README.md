# Tic-Tac-Tide & Tigers

##Overview:

"Tic-Tac-Tide & Tigers" is a simple, two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game with an Iron Bowl theme.  Auburn is the home team, 'Bama lost the coin toss, and Auburn has chosen to have the first move.

##Project Notes:

I chose this game because the logic behind it is simple, but a moderate challenge for my first-ever attempt at a game.  The logic was a fairly simple piece to solve.  Once it was finished, I worked on addid a 'New Game' button to reset the game board and set the counter back to 0.  I imported audio files using jQuery to play when a player wins the game.
